Final project - Synesthesia

I have a mild form of synesthesia in which I see a color association with letters and numbers that appears most strongly when, for some reason, looking at or thinking about typography. When looking at colors I can make the association with letters and numbers but the visual is much less powerful. 

As a professor in the DT program I've seen a number of synestheisa-related projects and its become a predictable theme across semesters. I've never had the itch to do a project of this nature but this final Met assignment seems like an opportunity to express some expression of my own synethesia. I'll be creating my own legend of letter/color associations and either selecting a single piece of art from which I'll produce a series of posters or I'll create a series from differing works of art. On a personal level I'm most interested in the former idea; doing a deeper examination of one work of art. 

I've produced a series of p5.js sketches that recreate works of art from the Met collection. I don't know where this is leading and don't have a clear picture in my head of the final form, which is what interests me as a designer and artist. I'm most interested in producing sketches and seeing where that leads me.

Things I'm interested in exploring within this framework:
• Descriptions of the artwork from the Met site
• Replacing pixels with their corresponding letters
• Reducing the numbers of pixels and seeing how this reduction influences color/letter associations.
• Producing letter-count graphs alongside each picture to visualize letter frequency
